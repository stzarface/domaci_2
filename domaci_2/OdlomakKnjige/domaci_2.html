			<p>
				<strong>Your brain on HTML and CSS.</strong> Here you are trying to learn something, while here your brain is doing you a favor by making sure the learning doesn’t stick. Your brain’s thinking, “Better leave room for more important things, like which wild animals to avoid thinking that your life depends on knowing HTML and CSS?

			<h3 id="secondsection">2. The Language of the Web</h3>
			<blockquote>
				The only thing that is standing between you and getting
				HyperText Markup Language, or HTML for short. - Elisabeth Robson, Eric Freeman
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				So, get ready for some language lessons. After this chapter, not only are you going to understand some basic elements of HTML, but you’ll also be able to speak HTML with a little style. Heck, by the end of this book, you’ll be talking <em>HTML</em> like you grew up in Webville.

			<h3 id="thirdsection">3. Meeting the “HT” in HTML</h3>
			<p>
				Did someone say <strong>hypertext</strong>? What’s that? Oh, only the entire basis of the Web. In Chapter 1 we kicked the tires of HTML and found it to be a nice markup language (the “ML” in HTML) for describing the structure of web pages. Now we’re going to check out the “HT” in HTML, hypertext, which will let us break free of a single page and link to other pages. Along the way we’re going to meet a powerful new element, the a element, and learn how being “relative” is a groovy thing. So, fasten your seat belts—you’re about to learn some hypertext.

			<h3 id="fourthsection">4. Web Page Construction</h3>
			<p>
				I was told I’d actually be creating web pages in this book? You’ve certainly learned a lot already: tags, elements, links, paths…but it’s all for
				nothing if you don’t create some killer web pages with that knowledge. In this chapter we’re going to ramp up construction: you’re going to take a web page from conception to blueprint, pour the foundation, build it, and even put on some finishing touches. All you need is your hard hat and your toolbelt, as we’ll be adding some new tools and giving you some insider knowledge that would make Tim “The Toolman” Taylor proud.

			<h3 id="fifthsection">5. A Trip to Webville</h3>
			<p>
				Web pages are a dish best served on the Internet. So far you’ve only created HTML pages that live on your own computer. You’ve also only linked to pages that are on your own computer. We’re about to change all that. In this chapter we’ll encourage you to get those web pages on the Internet
				where all your friends, fans, and customers can actually see them. We’ll also reveal the mysteries of linking to other pages by cracking the code of the <em>h, t, t, p, :, /, /, w, w, w.</em> So, gather your belongings; our next stop is Webville.

			<h3 id="sixthsection">6. Meeting the Media</h3>
			<p>
				Smile and say “cheese.” Actually, smile and say “gif,” “jpg,” or “png”—these are going to be your choices when “developing pictures” for the Web. In this chapter you’re going to learn all about adding your first media type to your pages: images. Got some digital photos you need to get online? No problem. Got a logo you need to get on your page? Got it covered. But before we get into all that, don’t you still need to be formally introduced to the img element? So sorry, we weren’t being rude; we just never saw the “right opening.” To make up for it, here’s an entire chapter devoted to img tag. By the end of the chapter you’re going to know all the ins and outs of how to use the img element and its attributes. You’re also going to see exactly how this little element causes the browser to do extra work to retrieve and display your images.

			<h3 id="seventhsection">7. Serious HTML</h3>
			<p>
				What else is there to know about HTML? You’re well on your way to mastering HTML. In fact, isn’t it about time we move on to CSS and learn how to make all this bland markup look fabulous? Before we do, we need to make sure your HTML is really ready for the big leagues. Don’t get us wrong, you’ve been writing first-class HTML all along, but there are just a few extra things you need to do to make it “industry standard” HTML. It’s also time you think about making sure you’re using the latest and greatest HTML standard, otherwise known as HTML5. By doing so, you’ll ensure that your pages play well with the latest i-Device, and that they’ll display more uniformly across all browsers (at least the ones you’d care about). You’ll also have pages that load faster, pages that are guaranteed to play well with CSS, and pages that are ready to move into the future as the standards grow. Get ready, this is the chapter where you move from web tinkerer to web professional.

			<h3 id="eighthsection">8. Adding a Little Style</h3>
			<p>
				I was told there’d be CSS in this book. So far you’ve been concentrating on learning HTML to create the structure of your web pages. But as you can see, the browser’s idea of style leaves a lot to be desired. Sure, we could call the fashion police, but we don’t need to. <strong>With CSS, you’re going to completely control the presentation of your pages often without even changing your HTML</strong>. Could it really be so easy? Well, you are going to have to learn a new language; after all, Webville is a bilingual town. After reading this chapter’s guide to learning the language of CSS, you’re going to be able to stand on either side of Main Street and hold a conversation.

			<h3 id="ninthsection">9. Expanding Your Vocabulary</h3>
			<p>
				Your CSS language lessons are coming along nicely. You already have the basics of CSS down, and you know how to create CSS rules to select and specify the style of an element. Now it’s time to build your vocabulary, and that means picking up some new properties and learning what they can do for you. In this chapter we’re going to work through some of the most common properties that affect the display of text. To do that, you’ll need to learn a few things about fonts and color. You’re going to see you don’t have to be stuck with the fonts everyone else uses, or the clunky sizes and styles the browser uses as the defaults for paragraphs and headings. You’re also going to see there is a lot more to color than meets the eye.

			<h3 id="tenthsection">10. Getting Intimate with Elements</h3>
			<p>
				To do advanced web construction, you really need to know your building materials. In this chapter we’re going to take a close look at our building materials: the HTML elements. We’re going to put block and inline elements right under the microscope and see what they’re made of. You’ll see how you can control just about every aspect of how an element is constructed with CSS. But we don’t stop there—you’ll also see how you can give elements unique identities. And, if that weren’t enough, you’re going to learn when and why you might want to use multiple stylesheets. So, turn the page and start getting intimate with elements

		<div>
			<h3 id="eleventhsection">11. Advanced Web Construction</h3>
			<p>
				It’s time to get ready for heavy construction. In this chapter we’re going to roll out two new HTML elements: div and span. These are no simple “two by fours”; these are full-blown steel beams. With div and span, you’re going to build some serious supporting structures, and once you’ve got those tructures in place, you’re going to be able to style them all in new and powerful ways. Now, we couldn’t help but notice that your CSS toolbelt is really starting to fill up, so it’s time to show you a few shortcuts that will make specifying all these properties a lot easier. And we’ve also got some special guests in this chapter, he pseudo-classes, which are going to allow you to create some very interesting selectors. (If you’re thinking that “pseudo-classes” would make a great name for your next band, too late; we beat you to it.)

			<h3 id="twelfthsection">12. Arranging Elements</h3>
			<p>
				It’s time to teach your HTML elements new tricks. We’re not going to let those HTML elements just sit there anymore—it’s about time they get up and help us create some pages with real layouts. How? Well, you’ve got a good feel for the div and span structural elements and you know all about how the box model works, right? So, now it’s time to use all that knowledge to craft some real esigns. No, we’re not just talking about more background and font colors—we’re talking about full-blown professional designs using multicolumn layouts. This is the chapter where everything you’ve learned comes together.

			<h3 id="thirtheenthsection">13. Modern HTML</h3>
			<p>
				So, we’re sure you’ve heard the hype around HTML5. And, given how far along you are in this book, you’re probably wondering if you made the right purchase. Now, one thing to be clear about, up front, is that everything you’ve learned in this book has been HTML, and more specifically has met the HTML5 standard. But there are some new aspects of HTML markup that were added with the HTML5 standard that we haven’t covered yet, and that’s what we’re going to do in this chapter. Most of these additions are evolutionary, and you’re going to find you are quite comfortable with them given all the hard work you’ve already done in this book. There’s some revolutionary stuff too (like video), and we’ll talk about that in this chapter as well. So, let’s dive in and take a look at these new additions!

			<h3 id="fourteenthsection">14. Getting Tabular</h3>
			<p>
				If it walks like a table and talks like a table… There comes a time in life when we have to deal with the dreaded tabular data. Whether you need to create a page representing your company’s inventory over the last year or a catalog of your vinylmation collection (don’t worry, we won’t tell), you know you need to do it in HTML, but how? Well, have we got a deal for you: order now, and in a single chapter we’ll reveal the secrets that will allow you to put your very own data right inside HTML tables. But there’s more: with every order we’ll throw in our exclusive guide to styling HTML tables. And, if you act now, as a special bonus, we’ll throw in our guide to styling HTML lists. Don’t hesitate; call now!

			<h3 id="fifteenthsection">15. Getting Interactive</h3>
			<p>
				So far all your web communication has been one-way: from your page to your visitors. Golly, wouldn’t it be nice if your visitors could talk back? That’s where HTML forms come in: once you enable your pages with forms (along with a little help from a web server), your pages are going to be able to gather customer feedback, take an online order, get the next move in an online game, or collect the votes in a “hot or not” contest. In this chapter you’re going to meet a whole team of HTML elements that work together to create web forms. You’ll also learn a bit about what goes on behind the scenes in the server to support forms, and we’ll even talk about keeping those forms stylish.

			<h3 id="sixtenthsection">16. The Top Ten Topics (We Didn’t Cover)</h3>
			<p>
				We covered a lot of ground, and you’re almost finished with this book. We’ll miss you, but before we let you go, we wouldn’t feel right about sending you out into the world without a little more preparation. We can’t possibly fit everything you’ll need to know into this relatively short chapter. Actually, we did originally include everything you need to know about HTML and CSS (not already covered by the other chapters), by reducing the type point size to .00004. It all fit, but nobody could read it. So, we threw most of it away, and kept the best bits for this Top Ten appendix.
